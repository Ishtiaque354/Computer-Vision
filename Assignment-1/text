1. Data Augmentation: Apply techniques to artificially increase the diversity of your training data.
2. Model Architecture: Choose or design an efficient model architecture suitable for your task.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and network depth.
4. Regularization: Use dropout, L2 regularization, and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
5. Transfer Learning: Leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them on your specific task.
